# Image Splitter

Downloaded manga sometimes contains two pages in one image. This tool separates the original images.

### Usage  
```bash   
$ split.py path_to_manga
```

Assuming the original path to the manga is `~/Documents/manga`, then the split manga will be created in `~/Documents/manga_splitted`
